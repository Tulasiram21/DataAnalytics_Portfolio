# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Day 1: Excel Basic Formulas Practice

This project contains my practice workbook to build foundational Excel skills for data analytics.  

- Practiced basic Excel formulas: `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.  
- Created a budget table to calculate total, average, minimum, and maximum expenses.  

These skills are essential building blocks for data cleaning and analysis jobs.
