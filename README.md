# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Day 1: Excel Basic Formulas Practice

This project contains my practice workbook to build foundational Excel skills for data analytics.  

- Practiced basic Excel formulas: `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.  
- Created a budget table to calculate total, average, minimum, and maximum expenses.  

## Day 2: Excel Data Sorting & Filtering Practice

- Practiced sorting a budget table by cost in ascending and descending order.  
- Applied filters to isolate expenses greater than $100.  
- Used multiple sheets in workbook to keep tasks organized.
